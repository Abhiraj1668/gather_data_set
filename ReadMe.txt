Hello
Thanks for helping me to gather data-set for my project.
Make sure your device has python 3.8 installed.
Here are the steps you will need to follow

1) Make sure you have opencv installed on your device
Use the following command in command prompt to install opencv
	pip install opencv-python
NOTE: this command might not work with python 3.9.0 or later

2) Once the package is installed you can run the main script
To run the main file enter the following command in command line
	python tst.py

3) Follow instructions as shown on command line

4) Zip the folder created with the entered name and mail me on d2l or at abhiraj@pdx.edu

5) I really appreciate your help.
